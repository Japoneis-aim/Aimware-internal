# Aimware — CS2 Internal Cheat

Internal DLL cheat for Counter-Strike 2. C++23, D3D11 overlay (ImGui), SafetyHook detours, custom schema-based SDK.

> **Disclaimer:** For educational/research purposes only. Use in CS2 violates Valve's ToS and can get you VAC banned. Use at your own risk.

> **Stability (v1.4):** Crash fixes and general bug fixes. More stable on map change, respawn and disconnect.

> **VAC:** Fixed VAC / "insecure client" error after 1-2 games. Launch the game normally from Steam without extra launch options (no `-insecure`, no `-allow_third_party_software`).

## Build

Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2022 (v145 toolset)
- Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0
- DirectX SDK (June 2010)

Steps:
1. Open `Aimware-Ai.sln`
2. Select **Release | x64**
3. Build

Output: `Aimware.dll`

Dependencies are vendored in `external/` (imgui, nlohmann/json, safetyhook).

---

## Inject

Use any manual-map injector. The DLL detects manual-map injection and sets up SEH, static init and the security cookie itself.

Known to work with:
- Process Hacker Native Injector
- Extreme Injector (manual map mode)

Unload with F4.

## Update Log

### v1.4 (current)
- **Crash fixes:** fixed crashes on map change, respawn and leaving a match
- **Bug fixes:** general fixes across visuals, movement and weapon logic

### v1.3
- **Trigger/Autofire scope fix:** scope / smoke / flash checks are now independent per mode — aimbot's checks no longer block triggerbot (trigger has its own smoke/flash/scope as shown in menu, autofire has its own). Fixed shared `aim_scoped_only` bug in `menu.cpp:602`/`756`, `config.cpp:551`, `triggerbot.cpp:1433`, `autofire.cpp:996`
- **Knife spawn fix:** fixed knife bugged model/animation for ~3s after spawn/respawn — skinchanger now reapplies for 90 frames on `m_flLastSpawnTimeIndex` change and fixes viewmodel even on spawn (`skinchanger.cpp:753`)

### v1.2
- **Crash fixes:** fixed random crashes on map change, respawn, leaving a match and after 2-3 rounds (safer hook teardown, entity validation, SEH hardening)
- **VAC fix:** fixed VAC / "insecure client" error after 1-2 games (stable launch-state bypass — launch normally from Steam, no `-insecure` / `-allow_third_party_software` needed)
- **Feature fixes:** aimbot / triggerbot / autofire, hitchance, nospread, visuals, chams / glow, world / fog / weather and movement are now more reliable
- **New skinchanger:** complete rewrite — faster, cleaner and more stable; knife / gloves / weapon skins (70+ slots), agents and preview improved
- **Performance:** removed bloat, optimized hooks / rendering / pattern scan — lower CPU/GPU overhead and less stutter

### v1.1
- Fixed crash when leaving a match (hooks now restore safely on their own thread)
- Fixed "insecure client" / VAC error after 1-2 games (bypasses the launch-state check; launch the game without extra launch options)
- Fixed aimbot/triggerbot not working while in spawn protection (TDM)
- Autofire now respects reaction, target-switch and first-shot delays in all modes
- Autofire smoothing now works with all smooth modes and humanization — no more silent-aim feel with silent aim off
- Menu UI fixes: garbled text, Config tab clipping, added missing Hitsound enable toggle

### v1.0
- Initial release build.
- Menu UI fixes: garbled text in Aim/Visuals tabs, Config tab card clipping (font manager + design section cut off).
- Added SDK offsets dump, project analysis doc.
